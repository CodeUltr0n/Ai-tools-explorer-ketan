🧠 Decisions Made

Here are some notable decisions made during the development of this project:

⸻

🧱 Framework: Next.js (App Router)
	•	Chosen for its server-side rendering, routing flexibility, and built-in API routes, making it ideal for full-stack AI applications.
	•	The App Router (introduced in Next 13+) was used to take advantage of modern routing, layouts, and use client capabilities.

⸻

🎨 Styling: Tailwind CSS
	•	Selected for its utility-first approach, allowing for rapid UI development without writing custom CSS.
	•	Ensures consistency, responsiveness, and clean design.

⸻

🔌 Image Generation API: Stability AI
	•	Used the Stable Diffusion XL model for its ability to produce high-quality images from detailed prompts.
	•	Base64 format was used for transferring and rendering generated images quickly.

⸻

💾 Image Handling
	•	Used next/image for optimal image loading, caching, and performance.
	•	Included buttons to download or copy the generated image for user convenience.

⸻

🧪 Error Handling
	•	Frontend handles errors gracefully with informative messages.
	•	Backend checks for missing prompts and missing API keys before proceeding.

⸻

🚀 Deployment: Vercel
	•	Chosen for ease of deployment, seamless GitHub integration, and great support for Next.js apps.
	•	Environment variables configured in the Vercel dashboard to keep secrets secure.

⸻

🧑‍💻 Developer Experience
	•	ESLint and TypeScript used to maintain code quality and catch issues early.
	•	Animations and interactive UI elements added for a better user experience.

 🙌 Closing Note

This project was developed as part of an internship assignment to demonstrate practical skills in full-stack development, AI integration, and UI/UX design. It reflects:
	•	A solid understanding of modern web development with Next.js and Tailwind CSS
	•	Integration of third-party APIs 
	•	A focus on performance, design, and user experience

I’m excited about the opportunity to contribute meaningfully to real-world projects and continue growing as a developer.
